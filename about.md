## About Me

### Hi!

Welcome to my website! At the moment it's a bit basic (if you couldn't tell already by the state of this about page) but one of these days I'll find some time to make it pretty. Anyways, about me: I'm a freshman at Harvard studying math and trying not to collapse under the immense weight of these psets. In my free time I like to code, take photos, eat food, and watch movies. That's pretty much it. Thanks for checking out my website! ðŸ˜Š
